total hours so far: 8

june 4th:
2 hours
Researching spindle motors, starting with this that way i know how much the most expensive part of the cnc is which that ways its easier to manage budget later.
still debating if i should use an ac motor or a dc motor. Also researched what kind of bits i should be using and kind of at what speeds i can expect to cut aluminum with different setups.

week of june 22nd:
6 hours
so im still not quite sure about the motors power i talked to some people and they said that even if a 500w motor might cut aluminum itl be painfully slow and wear the bits down fast.
They said i should go for a motor thats just not powerfull enough to trip my breakers. unfortunately for me thats not much since i onlly have access to 120 15a so thats a bit over 1.7kw so i think a motor
around 1.2kw will be optimal that way i still have power for the rest of the cnc and have some head room just in case. Also for the frame i think im going to use 4040 extrusion and have a cut area of 30-40cm.
When i need to cut something bigger ill have to manually reposition the part but this way it shouldnt be too expensive and itl be pretty sturdy and compact which is also a factor i want to keep into consideration now.
