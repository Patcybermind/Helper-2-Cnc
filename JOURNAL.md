Researching spindle motors, starting with this that way i know how much the most expensive part of the cnc is which that ways its easier to manage budget later.
still debating if i should use an ac motor or a dc motor. Also researched what kind of bits i should be using and kind of at what speeds i can expect to cut aluminum with different setups.
